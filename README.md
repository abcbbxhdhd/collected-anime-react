# Hey, I wanna tell what I have done in this a little bit challenging project

## Things that I used here
<ul>
  <li>As always, basic react hooks (useState for stating and useEffect for fetching data depending on sth</li>
  <li>React Router and its hooks (useLocation, useParams, useSearchParams and others)</li>
  <li>Maybe I invented new React project structure :)</li>
  <li>Redux instead of React Context to store global states and its hooks (useSelector, useDispatch)</li>
</ul>

### Also my frontend became better. I hope............
### So, I am moving forward and continue learning and practicing React!!!
